        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">What is a Carbon Footprint?</h3>
        <p>
            A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide and methane) 
            that are generated by our actions. The average carbon footprint for a person in India is 
            approximately 1.9 tons per year, which is significantly lower than the global average but is growing rapidly with economic development.
        </p>
        <p>
            Globally, the average carbon footprint is closer to 4 tons. To have the best chance of avoiding a 
            2℃ rise in global temperatures, the average global carbon footprint per person needs to drop to 
            under 2 tons by 2050. As India continues to develop, balancing economic growth with sustainable practices becomes increasingly important.

        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Our Calculation Methodology</h3>
        <p>
            Our calculator estimates your carbon footprint based on your inputs in three main categories:

                <h5>Car Travel</h5>
                <p>
                    We calculate emissions based on kilometers driven and your vehicle's fuel efficiency (km/liter).
                    The formula uses the standard emission factor of 2.31 kg CO₂e per liter of petrol.
                </p>
                <code>Car emissions = (Kilometers driven × 52 weeks) ÷ km/liter × 2.31 kg CO₂e/liter</code>
                
                <h5 class="mt-3">Two-Wheeler Travel</h5>
                <p>
                    Emissions from motorcycles and scooters (very common in India) use the same factor of 2.31 kg CO₂e per liter but generally higher efficiency.
                </p>
                <code>Two-wheeler emissions = (Kilometers driven × 52 weeks) ÷ km/liter × 2.31 kg CO₂e/liter</code>
                
                <h5 class="mt-3">Auto Rickshaw</h5>
                <p>
                    Emissions from auto rickshaws (common in Indian cities) use an average factor of 0.08 kg CO₂e per passenger kilometer.
                </p>
                <code>Auto rickshaw emissions = Kilometers traveled × 52 weeks × 0.08 kg CO₂e/km</code>
                
                <h5 class="mt-3">Public Transit</h5>
                <p>
                    Emissions from public transit like buses and metro use an average factor of 0.04 kg CO₂e per passenger kilometer in India.
                </p>
                <code>Public transit emissions = Kilometers traveled × 52 weeks × 0.04 kg CO₂e/km</code>
                
                <h5 class="mt-3">Air Travel</h5>
                <p>
                    For simplicity in the Indian context, we categorize flights as domestic or international:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Domestic flights (within India): 300 kg CO₂e per round trip</li>
                    <li>International flights (from India to other countries): 2000 kg CO₂e per round trip</li>

                <h5>Electricity</h5>
                <p>
                    Emissions from electricity use the U.S. average emission factor of 0.45 kg CO₂e per kWh.
                    This varies by region based on the energy mix (coal, natural gas, nuclear, renewables).
                </p>
                <code>Electricity emissions = kWh per month × 12 months × 0.45 kg CO₂e/kWh</code>
                
                <h5 class="mt-3">Natural Gas</h5>
                <p>
                    Natural gas emissions are calculated using the standard factor of 5.3 kg CO₂e per therm.
                </p>
                <code>Natural gas emissions = Therms per month × 12 months × 5.3 kg CO₂e/therm</code>
                
                <h5 class="mt-3">Heating Oil</h5>
                <p>
                    Heating oil emissions are calculated using the factor of 10.16 kg CO₂e per gallon.
                </p>
                <code>Heating oil emissions = Gallons per month × 12 months × 10.16 kg CO₂e/gallon</code>

        <p>
            Our emission factors are derived from multiple reputable sources, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</li>
            <li>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)</li>

        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Limitations</h3>
        <p>
            While our calculator provides a reasonable estimate of your carbon footprint, it has limitations:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Regional variations in emission factors are not fully accounted for</li>
            <li>Simplified assumptions about lifestyle patterns</li>
            <li>Does not account for all sources of emissions (e.g., goods purchased)</li>
            <li>Based on average emission factors that may not reflect your specific situation</li>
        </ul>
